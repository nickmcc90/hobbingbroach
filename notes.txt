I'm making a website with code because I find this to be an easy way to organize data 
with a clean interface using javascript.

How I set this interface up:
1. Open up VScode
2. Open up a terminal inside VScode
3. Type in the terminal " npm create vite@latest ‘project name’ "
3.5 Choose what you want in the terminal in your react app
3.9 Open up the folder you just created in VScode
4. cd 'project name'
5. npm install
6. npm install node
7. sudo npm install n -g
8. npm run dev
9. Copy and paste the website link into a browser !
