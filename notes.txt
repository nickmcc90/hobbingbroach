I'm making a website with code because I find this to be an easy way to organize data 
with a clean interface using javascript.

How I set this interface up:
1. Open up VScode
2. Open up a terminal inside VScode
3. Type in the terminal " npm create vite@latest ‘project name’ "
3.5 Choose what you want in the terminal in your react app
3.9 Open up the folder you just created in VScode
4. cd 'project name'
5. npm install
6. npm install node
7. sudo npm install n -g
8. npm run dev
9. Copy and paste the website link into a browser !


How I set this up in github:
1. Went to terminal in Apple computer and navigated to 'project name'
2. git init
3. git add .
4. git commit -m "commit notes"
5. git log (to see that it worked)
6. Go to github and create a new repository
7. Copy the HTTPS link that it gives you
8. Go back to the terminal in apple computer and type git remote add origin "link"
9. Type git remote to see that it worked
10. git push origin main

**If step 10 doesn't work, we need to create a personal access token**
10a. Go to github profile icon
10b. Click settings
10c. Scroll down the left side banner and click developer settings
10d. Click personal access tokens and choose tokens (classic) 
10e. Click generate new token, and choose the classic version
10f. Name the token and only select all the checkmarks for the "repo" category
10g. Choose an expiration date of 90 days preferably. 
10h. Generate the token with the green button
10i. Copy the access token link and paste it in your notes. You'll need it for step 10 again.
10j. Retype git push origin main
10k. When it asks for the password, paste the password given to you by the token.
10l. You can upload versions to github now !!!
